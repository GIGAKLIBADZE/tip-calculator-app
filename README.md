## My process

I used mobile first workflow while building this project. Then I added/modified styles for the desktop version. Finally, I added some javascript code block for the desktop version, I used DOM for these things.

### Built with

Semantic HTML5 markup
CSS custom properties
Flexbox
Mobile-first workflow
JavaScript
DOM

### What I learned

After created many HTML/CSS projects and in one of them I used a tiny little JavaScript, In this one I learned how to use use DOM also. I got familiar with HTML input tag specifications and some CSS features which were brand new for me. And the most important is how my knowledge increased about DOM after building this project.

### Continued development

Now, after building some markup projects, I am going to deeply learn JavaScript and DOM. Then I will continue constructing more complex projects by using my new knowledge.
